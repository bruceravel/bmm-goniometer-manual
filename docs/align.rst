Goniometer alignment for XRR
============================

To start, place the Mythen in the most downstream position on the
:olive:`(what is the arm called?)` Measure and record the gap value |nd|
typically around 90 mm.  See :numref:`Figure %s <fig-gap>` for a photo
identifying what the gap is.


XRD mode of the Photon Delivery System
--------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Future Tech!

   Implement ``change_edge()`` in this profile.

   Also need to explain how to use that to change energy



Direct beam camera
------------------

Attach the mounting bracker for the direct beam camera to its mount
point on the floor, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-yag>`.  When
securing the mounting bracket to the floor, slide the spacing plate
between the bracket's horizontal member and the counterweight of the
mu circle.  This assures that the goniometer table moves freely during
alignment and that the camera is close to the correct height relative
to the beam.

   The mount for the direct beam camera


Once the direct beam camera is in place and powered up, turn the
analog video switch to the correct setting.  This switch is on the XAS
control station, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-anacam_switch>`.
Also mount the alignment pin on the goniometer head.

Verify that the direct beam hits the camera, then evaluate the size
and shape of the beam. You may want to apply some attenuation to the
beam |nd| the YAG crystal bleeds at high flux, making it hard to
assess the actual size and shape of the beam.

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mv(attenuator, 2))

The beam should be a small oval with the axes of the oval parallel and
perpendicular to gravity.  If the oval is slanted, try adjusting the
yaw of the focusing mirror (:numref:`See Section %s
<focusing_mirror>`), for example

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvr(m2.yaw, 0.01))


With the shadow of the pin in the focused, direct beam, note its
position on screen.  Rotate the phi axis by 180 degrees.  Note the new
position.  Find the center point of these two positions and move
``table.lateral`` to place the center of the beam at that center
point using command like this:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvr(table.lateral, 0.25))

Rotate the chi circle by -90 degrees so that the pin is in the
horizontal plane.  Repeat the procedure of noting the position,
rotating phi by 180 degrees, and finding the center point.  Place the
beam at the center point by doing

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvr(table.vertical, 0.25))

Read and record the table motor positions.

See :numref:`Section %s <goniometer_table>` for details of table
movement.



.. admonition:: Future Tech!

   Direct beam camera that can be read via AreaDetector.  Do image
   analysis on shadow of pin to compute correct ``table.vertical`` and
   ``table.lateral`` positions.

.. _slit_align:

Slit alignment
--------------

Open the slits to their fully open position:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvr(slits.hsize, 8))
   RE(mvr(slits.vsize, 8))

The direct beam should still be visible on the direct beam camera.


.. note:: What to do if the beam is not near the center of the slits?


To align and calibrate the goniometer slits, do

.. code-block:: python

   RE(align_slits())

The optional arguments to this plan are

``nsteps``
  Number of steps in each scan (default is 31)

``move``
  If True, move to the centroid (default is True)

``calibrate``
  If True, reset offset so that centroid is at 0

``inttime``
  Scan dwell time (default is 0.5 seconds)



The slit alignment procedure will run a linescan :olive:`(need link to
linescan explanation)` on each of the four slits individually,
plotting the signal on the monitor :olive:`(need link to monitor
explanation)` versus slit position.  This signal should be a step-like
function, so the result is fit to an error function.  The slit is
moved to the centroid of the fitted error function and the offset of
the slit is reset to define the zero position.  The result of an
individual slit scan looks like :numref:`Figure %s <fig-slitscan>`.

   :target: _images/slit_bot.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   The fit to an individual slit scan, in this case, bottom blade.

Once aligned and calibrated, set the slit size for the experiment,
something like 

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvr(slits.hsize, 1))
   RE(mvr(slits.vsize, 0.120))

.. _dethor_align:

Horizontal detector alignment
-----------------------------

With the beam in the center of the goniometer and in the center of the
slits, we next align the Mythen with the direct beam.  To do so, we
perform a linescan of the ``dethor`` axis, moving the detector across
the incident beam.

The attenuator needs to be set to a value suitable for the incident
beam, something like:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mv(attenuator, 7))

then perform a linescan of the dethor motor:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(linescan(dethor, 'mythen', -3, 3, 61)

The live plot will show the progress of the scan.  Once the scan is
finished, some simple peak interpretation is performed, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-dethor>`.

The peak-like shape is reduced to find the peak, the center of mass
(the "com"), and the center of the full width at half maximum
(the "cen").  In this case, ``dethor`` is moved to the cen value.

.. _fig-dethor:
.. figure:: _images/align/dethor.png
   :target: _images/dethor.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Interpretation of the horizontal scan of ``dethor`` to center the
   Mythen on the incident beam.

At this point, take a count on the Mythen to find the position of the
direct beam on the detector.  Set the dwell_time to something short
and do an exposure.

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mv(dwell_time, 0.1))
   RE(count([mythen], 1))

The signal from the exposure will have a peak centered on some pixel.
If the slits are 120 |mu|\ m, then the direct beam will illuminate 3
or 4 strips, as the strip width is 50 |mu|\ m, as shown on the
`Mythen2 specification sheet
<https://dectris.com/en/detectors/x-ray-detectors/mythen2/mythen2-for-synchrotrons/>`__
and there 1280 strips on the detector.

The direct beam should be around the 200\ :sup:`th` strip.  Adjust the
gap on the flight path holder so that is approximately true.  A simple
calculation of the center of the illuminated area from the count will
be good enough. This places the beam closer to the bottom of the
detector, thus most of the strips are above the direct beam |nd| also,
then, the reflected beam in an XRR experiment.  See :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-gap>`.


.. _fig-gap:
.. figure:: _images/align/gap.jpg
   :target: _images/gap.jpg
   :width: 75%
   :align: center

   The gap measures the elevation of the Mythen and
   its flight path on the hand-operated vertical jack.

.. _mythen_cal:

Mythen Calibration
------------------

With the beam around strip 200, run a linescan of delta, plotting the
signal from the full MCA spectrum from the Mythen.  This will be
dominated by the integral under the 3 or 4 strip wide peak due to the
direct beam.

This scan will find the extent of the detector in delta.  As the beam
passes over the detector, the signal will be approximately constant.

Typical scan parameters are:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mythen_calibration(-4, 1, 1001))

The optional arguments to ``mythen_calibration`` are:

``start``
  From delta=0, the starting angle of the scan, in degrees

``stop``
  From delta=0, the ending position of the scan, in degrees

``nsteps``
  The number of steps in the scan

``inttime``
  The dwell time at each point in the scan. Default is 0.1 seconds

``force``
  When true, force the scan to run even if the beamline is not ready
  (e.g. no beam). Default is False.

The live plot will look something like :numref:`Figure %s <fig-mythencal>`.

.. _fig-mythencal:
.. figure:: _images/align/mythen_cal.png
   :target: _images/mythen_cal.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   A liveplot of the Mythen full MCA integration versus delta angle.

When the linescan in delta is finished, some data reduction happens
and a report is generated.  This report is written to the screen.  It
is also written to a PowerPoint file in the data folder.  It's
contents look something like :numref:`Figure %s <fig-calibration_report>`.



.. _fig-calibration_report:
.. figure:: _images/align/calibration_report.png
   :target: _images/calibration_report.png
   :width: 95%
   :align: center

   An image of the PowerPoint report made on the Mythen calibration
   scan.  (Note: there are some obvious errors in this picture.
   Picture will be updated once the report is fixed.)

In the upper right corner of this report, the path to the proposal
folder is written as is the UID of the Tiled record.  The numerical
results of the fit are given in the main text.  A plot of fit to the
beam position on the detector is shown in the plot.  Form this fit, we
get the formula for mapping delta angle to direct beam detector
position, as well as values for the gap, the distance form the
goniometer eucentric to the detector, and the pixel underneath the
direct beam at delta=0.

Once this analysis is finished, the ROIs for the direct and reflected
beam are set.  Those values and the slits sizes are also in the
report.

You can visualize the ROIs over the direct beam spectrum by moving
delta to 0, doing a count, then plotting the spectrum just counted.

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mv(delta, 0))
   RE(count([mythen], 1))
   mythen.plot(N)

The value of N in the ``mythen.plot`` function identifies which ROI
will be shown in the plot.

``mythen.plot(0)``
  This will show the full MCA spectrum ROI, i.e. the entire detector

``mythen.plot(1)``
  This will show the direct beam ROI.  As this is only a few strips
  wide, it is hard to see at full scale.

``mythen.plot(2)``
  This will show the reflected beam ROI.  This is still quite narrow,
  but more apparent than the direct beam ROI.

.. _fig-directbeamROI:
.. figure:: _images/dummy.png
   :target: _images/dummy.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   A zoomed-in view of the direct beam ROI on top of the MCA spectrum,
   made using ``mythen.plot(1)``.


As a final check of the instrument alignment and the setting of the
detector ROIs, do a linescan with rather fine steps of delta.  The
live plot will show the direct beam ROI and the wider, reflected beam
ROI as functions of delta.  The narrower direct beam ROI should be
well centered within the reflected beam ROI.  If it is not, then
something about the instrument alignment or the setting of the ROIs
was done incorrectly.

At the end of the scan, the direct beam peak is interpreted for peak,
com, and cen positions.  The offset of the delta motor is reset so
that the cen is at 0.  This should be a very small change in offset.

.. _fig-deltadirect:
.. figure:: _images/align/delta_direct.png
   :target: _images/delta_direct.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Showing the interpretation of the direct beam ROI as a function of
   delta angle.  This should be narrow and centered very close to 0.
   Note that the com and cen are at the same position.  This is a good
   alignment!
