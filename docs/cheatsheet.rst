Command cheatsheet
==================

This section provides a quick summary of the data acquisition commands
discussed in the previous sections.

.. admonition:: Stopping a measurement
   :class: attention

   To stop any command do :key:`Ctrl`-:key:`C` :key:`Ctrl`-:key:`C`

   That is, hit :key:`Ctrl`-:key:`C` twice!

   This will **pause** the running command and return you to the command line.

   Do ``RE.resume()`` to continue the command from where it stopped.

   Do ``RE.stop()`` to fully stop the command.


.. note:: Parentheses |nd| ``()`` |nd| are an essential part of the
          syntax.  Same for ``RE()`` and ``%`` when specified.
