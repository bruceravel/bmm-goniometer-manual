.. _intro:

Introduction to BMM
===================

BMM is NIST's :red:`B`\ eamline for :red:`M`\ aterials :red:`M`\ easurement.

At the unix command line, do this to start the Bluesky user
interface

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/.ipython/profile_goniometer
   pixi run start



|bsui| is simply an `IPython shell <https://ipython.org/>`_
with some customizations specific to Bluesky.  On top of that, there
are a number of customizations specific to BMM.


In this user manual, there are chapters covering most of the chores
one will need to do at the beamline, including:

#. moving motors
#. making motor scans
#. making reflectivity and pole figure scans
#. troubleshooting common problems

TL;DR
-----

**Open/close the shutter**
   ``shb.open()`` and ``shb.close()``, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <shutters>`

**Sample alignment scans**
   Use the ``RE(linescan())`` command, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <linescan>`


..
   **Change energy**
      Use the ``RE(change_edge())`` command, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <pds>`


   **XAFS scan**
      Use the ``RE(xafs())`` command, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <xafsscan>`

   **Import an automation spreadsheet**
      Prepare a spreadsheet, then ``xlsx()``, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <automation>`

   **Details, details, details**

.. _slack:

Slack and Data Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of your experiment, you will be invited to the BMM
Slack workspace.  There you can follow along with the progress of the
experiment in the ``#pass-123456-bmm channel``, where ``123456`` will
be the proposal number of your experiment.

There is also a channel called ``#pass-123456`` which is for use as a
discussion channel.

Throughout the course of the experiment, messages and figures will be
automatically posted to that channel.  This allows someone to keep
track of progress and to keep an eye on data quality without being
physically at the beamline.

BMM and Building 743
--------------------


BMM is on the south side of the NSLS-II building: `what3words:
///width.corrugated.support
<https://what3words.com/width.corrugated.support>`__

You should park at building 743 and enter through the main entrance
of 743.

   Route from the Main Gate to Building 743


Walk though the lobby to the doors that lead out onto the experimental
floor.  BMM is just across the walk way from the doors to the 743 lobby.

   and head into the BMM control station




BMM's staff have offices on the outer hallway of Building 743.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Pride of place goes to the late Jimmy Biancarosa and to Don Abel, the
excellent technicians who helped build BMM and outfit it with kit
that works.  Truly nothing would have ever happened at BMM without them.

BMM's `Bluesky <https://blueskyproject.io/>`__ profile was mostly
written by Bruce.  But this would not have happened without the help
of several members of NSLS-II's DSSI program.  In particular, I want
to thank Dan Allan, Tom Caswell, Josh Lynch, Jakub Wlodek, Max
Rakitin, Dmitri Gavrilov, Stuart Campbell, Abby Giles, Garrett Bishof,
Nate Maytan, Matt Snyder, Oksana Ivashkevych, Ryan Jaskiel, AJ Sliger,
and Jun Ma.  

Thanks to every BMM user |nd| being a BMM user means being a beta tester
for the beamline software!

BMM makes use of `lots of great python tools
<https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/the-unexpected-effectiveness-of-python-in-science?slide=52>`__.
Matt Newville's `Larch <http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/>`__ is used
to process every XAS scan that gets measured and Matt's `lmfit
<https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`__ is used for many alignment
chores.

This documentation project uses `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`__ and the lovely
`{book}theme
<https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
from the `The Executable Book Project
<https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/>`__.  Appendices are numbered properly
using the ``appendix.py`` extension from

This manual uses a GitHub action to build and deploy `(see details
